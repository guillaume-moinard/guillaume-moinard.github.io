## What do they do?
Here is a video of walkers following a tactic on a street network. They align with each others' directions and move together. We color walkers with a same color if they end up in the same group at the end of the run. The size of a node is proportional to the number of walkers on it.
We only display walkers that end up in the 10 biggest groups.

## Flocking of protesters
We study what tactics walkers should follow in order to gather *and* subsequently move together on a street network. This describes events such as protests.

    We get a scatter plot, where the best tactics are those in the upper right corner.

We also use data such as POI, width of streets etc, to gather such walkers on the street network.

## Impact on network
Work in progress.
