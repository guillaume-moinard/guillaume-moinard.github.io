## Flocking of protesters
We study what tactics walkers should follow in order to gather *and* subsequently move together on a street network. This describes events such as protests.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="/assets/img/publication_preview/scatter-1.jpg" title="Scatter plot of tactics" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    We get a scatter plot, where the best tactics are those in the upper right corner.
</div>

We also use data such as POI, width of streets etc, to gather such walkers on the street network.

## Impact on network
Work in progress.
