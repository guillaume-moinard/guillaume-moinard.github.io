Focus on my research

Hold on ! "Social movements" and "Science" ? What's the link ?
Well, my main interest is an interdisciplinary one : I intend to use skills from different fields in order to tackle questions at the edges of thoses fields. Concretely, I model a city as a complex network. I focus on pedestrian dynamics in cities, using tools from graph theory, game theory and statistical physics, to measure the impact of a given protest or demonstration.
