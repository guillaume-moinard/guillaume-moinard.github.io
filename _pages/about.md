## Hi folks, and welcome ! ü¶ä

I am doing a PhD in computer science at Sorbonne University, under the supervision of [Matthieu Latapy](https://www-complexnetworks.lip6.fr/~latapy/) with the [Complex Networks](https://www.complexnetworks.fr/) team.
This website is dedicated to my work on **science, social movements**, and all sorts of ideas !

> Hold on ! "*Social movements*" and "*Science*" ? What's the link ?

Well, my main interest is an interdisciplinary one : I use skills from different fields in order to study events such as protests or demonstrations. I model a city as a complex network and activists as biased random walkers. Then tools from graph theory, game theory and statistical physics, allow me to measure the impact of a given action.
