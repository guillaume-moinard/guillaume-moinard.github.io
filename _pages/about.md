## Hi folks, and welcome ! ü¶ä

I am doing a PhD in computer science at Sorbonne University, under the supervision of [Matthieu Latapy](https://www-complexnetworks.lip6.fr/~latapy/) with the [Complex Networks](https://www.complexnetworks.fr/) team.
This website is dedicated to my work on **network science, social movements**, and all sorts of ideas !

> Hold on ! "*Social movements*" and "*Science*" ? What's the link ?

Yes ! My main interest is an interdisciplinary one : I study events such as protests or demonstrations as a computer science problem.

Imagine a group of people, scattered over a city. How can they meet? Coordinating, by exchanging their positions thanks to modern means of communication, seems easy. But how to achieve the same result if communications are impossible and no meeting point is identifiable? This is the case, for example, during a repressed social movement or a blackout.

The objective of my thesis is to find the key ingredients for a movement tactic to ensure that walkers will meet in the same place, regardless of their starting positions. I model a city as a street network, a graph, and protesters as biased random walkers. I can then identify what are the best walking rules for effective gatherings in such context.
