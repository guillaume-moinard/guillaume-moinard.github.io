## Courses üìñ

### Classes
Some material for students following courses I teach :
- Python : an example of [anki deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/51975584) for revising python
- Algorithm : A good video on [binary search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDn8iOc30Tk) that illustrates what I showed in class.


### Videos
- [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/@Computerphile), excellent videos on computer science concepts and algorithms
- [Science √âtonnante](https://www.youtube.com/@ScienceEtonnante), french channel on many science topics

## Tools üõ†Ô∏è

A list of some (very) usefull tools both for studying and research. Of course what matters is not to use *those* specific tools. They still might be pleasant work tools for some of you.

### Workflow
- [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) for note taking
- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for spaced course learning

### Bibliography
- [Litmaps](https://app.litmaps.co) for visualizing your bibliography
- [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) an open database of scholarly papers

Many good tutorials are available for those tools on their website.
