## classes
Some material for students following courses I teach :

# Tools

A list of some (very) usefull tools both for studying and research. Of course what matters is not to use *those* specific tools, but to have a workflow.

- [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/)
- [Litmaps](https://app.litmaps.co)
- [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/)
- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)

Many good tutorails are available for those tools on their website.
